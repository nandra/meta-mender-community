# Mender integration for SUNXI boards

Supported boards:

- OrangePi PC Plus

*NOTE*! Even though the integration has only been tested on OrangePi PC Plus
all the SUNXI boards share the same U-boot configuration
(where the integration work is) which means that it probably works on other
boards as well without any additional work.
